  				 WiCHacks is an all women 24-hour hackathon hosted by Women in 
  				 Computing at RIT. A hackathon is a collaborative programming 
  				 event in which participants create an app, website, game, or 
  				 other piece of software over the course of the event. 
  				 Hackathon participants can be female college (including non-RIT) 
  				 or high school students who are at least 16 years of age.
  				 This event is open to women of all skill levels: those who havenâ€™t 
  				 programmed at all, women who have done some programming, and the best 
  				 women programmers out there. It will be a great day to learn, invent, 
  				 and create the future.
