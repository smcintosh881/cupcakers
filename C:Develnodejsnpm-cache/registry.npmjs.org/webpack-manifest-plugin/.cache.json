Webpack Manifest Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin?branch=master) [![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg)](https://gitter.im/webpack-manifest-plugin#)\n\n\nWebpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-manifest-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your `webpack.config.js`\n\n```javascript\nvar ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    // ...\n    plugins: [\n      new ManifestPlugin()\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nThis will generate a `manifest.json` file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mods/alpha.js\": \"mods/alpha.1234567890.js\",\n  \"mods/omega.js\": \"mods/omega.0987654321.js\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nA manifest is configurable using constructor options:\n\n```javascript\nnew ManifestPlugin({\n  fileName: 'my-manifest.json',\n  basePath: '/app/'\n  seed: {\n    name: 'My Manifest'\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Options:\n\n### `fileName`\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `manifest.json`\n\nThe manifest filename in your output directory.\n\n\n### `basePath`\n\nType: `String`\n\nA path prefix for all file references. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.\n\n\n### `publicPath`\n\nType: `String`\n\nA path prefix used only on output files, similar to Webpack's  [output.publicPath](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/configuration#outputpublicpath). Ignored if `basePath` was also provided.\n\n\n### `stripSrc`\n\nType: `String`, `RegExp`\n\nRemoves unwanted strings from source filenames.\n\n\n### `writeToFileEmit`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to `true` will emit to build folder and memory in combination with `webpack-dev-server`\n\n\n### `seed`\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: `{}`\n\nA cache of key/value pairs to used to seed the manifest. This may include a set of [custom key/value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) pairs to include in your manifest, or may be used to combine manifests across compilations in [multi-compiler mode](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler). To combine manifests, pass a shared seed object to each compiler's ManifestPlugin instance.\n\n### `filter`\n\nType: `function`\n\nFilter out files. [more details](#hooks-options)\n\n\n### `map`\n\nType: `function`\n\nModify files details before the manifest is created. [more details](#hooks-options)\n\n\n### `reduce`\n\nType: `function`<br>\nDefault: `(manifest, {name, path}) => ({...manifest, [name]: path})`\n\nCreate the manifest. It can return anything as long as it's serialisable by `JSON.stringify`. Use the `seed` options to populate `manifest`. [more details](#hooks-options)\n\n\n## Hooks Options\n\n`filter`, `map`, `reduce` takes as an input an Object with the following properties:\n\n### `path`\n\nType: `String`\n\n\n### `chunk`\n\nType: [`Chunk`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/Chunk.js)\n\n\n### `name`\n\nType: `String`, `null`\n\n\n### `isChunk`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\n\n### `isInitial`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIs required to run you app. Cannot be `true` if `isChunk` is `false`.\n\n\n### `isAsset`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\n\n### `isModuleAsset`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIs required by a module. Cannot be `true` if `isAsset` is `false`.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Dane Thurber](https://github.com/danethurber)\n","maintainers":[{"email":"th.sileghem@gmail.com","name":"mastilver"},{"email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com","name":"danethurber"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-30T13:35:17.029Z","created":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-21T21:00:37.797Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-07T23:11:34.573Z","0.3.0":"2015-07-02T14:20:18.411Z","0.4.0":"2015-08-06T21:12:09.881Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-31T14:18:07.275Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-07T16:55:53.554Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-26T02:33:18.022Z","1.1.0-0":"2016-10-19T15:26:15.276Z","1.1.0":"2016-10-19T15:36:52.850Z","1.1.1":"2017-07-06T19:23:17.713Z","1.1.2":"2017-07-07T14:07:06.239Z","1.2.0":"2017-07-20T18:34:20.255Z","1.2.1":"2017-07-20T23:09:14.488Z","1.3.0":"2017-08-09T20:58:36.353Z","1.3.1":"2017-08-14T11:57:58.907Z","1.3.2":"2017-09-14T12:39:52.622Z","2.0.0-rc.1":"2017-09-21T12:00:00.621Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Dane Thurber","email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"qbylucky":true,"ackhub":true,"cognivator":true,"detj":true,"jcurtis":true,"gabrielschlomo":true,"sqrtthree":true,"xu_q90":true,"arkanciscan":true,"bourne":true,"zhilidali":true,"fengmiaosen":true,"landy2014":true,"bro_strummer":true,"martinspinks":true,"sszhu":true,"rbultitude":true,"myalin":true,"budiantoip":true,"luffy84217":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59cf9d95-7bde\"","_lastModified":"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 13:35:17 GMT"}
